# Pokedex Project

Deployed Link: https://zashii.github.io/GroupProject/index.html

This is a Pokedex project site that recreates the original Pokedex experience by fetching data through the PokeAPI, a database of Pokemon information, and VoiceRSS API, an API that provides an audio voice that reads the information on screen much like the original Pokedex.

This website also has a maps page which utilizes Firebase and Google Maps API to connect nearby users who are also using this app to bring together fellow Pokemon aficionados.

The frontend is designed using CSS, Bootstrap, and Materialize.
The backend is designed using web APIs through Ajax, Javascript, Jquery, and usage of the Firebase real-time database.

The PokeDex page is the main part of the app. It allows users to search for Pokemon as well as check for their evolutions and special forms, all within an authentic Pokedex display layout.
